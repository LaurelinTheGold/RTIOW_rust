xorshift32 for pseudorandom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift
reference single rng 

each thread gets own rng but make them static and just next random instead of spawning new rng each time needed

rayon to parallelize

    Notie Copy requires Clone but they do different things; copy means not move


cfg debug for easier debug

scene.rs for random scene, cornell, etc

add triangles and stuff

render.rs

chill with the Rc pointers

u8 as the color

imagemagick: convert x.ppm x.png

gitbash or wsl
$ RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm" cargo build --release && cargo run --release > image_balls.ppm

const and tail call recursion 
generic types for vectors


buffer/queue mutex gated pipeline of random numbers that threads take? nondeterministic order

apparenlty glam is good for graphics linalg while nalgebra/ndarray/lapack/blas is for general purpose linalg
